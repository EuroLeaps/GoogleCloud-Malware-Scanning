# AntiVirus AntiMalware Scanning for GoogleCloud

This scanner allows you to scan Google Cloud resources, starting with Cloud Storage, using VirusTotal. This is deployed as a Cloud Function in your Google Cloud project. You need to use your own VirusTotal API key.

The scanner does not send any of your files or data to VirusTotal, instead it only uses the MD5 hash of the files to call the VirusTotal API.
